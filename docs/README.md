## A Very Brief History of the Internet
The 1960s saw the birth of the what would become the internet we know today, ARPANET or the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network, it was developed so scientists could communicate during the cold war and data could be shared across multiple computers mainly to prevent losing all data should one of the computers fail. The very first message was sent in 1969, the same year as the Moon Landing. The message was "Login" but only "Lo" made it, it was still a great achievement for the time.<br/><br/>Skip to the 80s, Vinton Cerf had already invented a method to communicate globally, called Transmission Control Protocol, and was followed by IP(Internet Protocol). Then scientists developed Cerf's Protocol to send data back and forth and then the 90s happened and Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web we use today. <br/><br/>It was a revolution, it wasn't just for scientists now, it was for everyone. Erwise was invented in '92 and it was the first browser to have a graphical interface. It lead the way and in '95 Netscape Navigator became the most popular browser of the time accomodating 90% of global traffic. Dial-up became a thing, it used your phone line to connect to the internet hence the name "dial up" and it meant that you couldn't use the phone and surf the web simultaneously. The rest we are all familiar with, Facebook, Youtube, News, Twitter, the ability to know anything in seconds without having to read a book or even talk to someone.<br/><br/>FYI the first thing ever purchased on the internet was a Pizza. Where would we be without it!
